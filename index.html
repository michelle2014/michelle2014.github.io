          <p>In Modules 2 and 3, you've been building on a Web page that displays personal information about you. For this module project, we are going to continue to build on that work and turn our profile into a "resume" or "CV". </p>

          <p> It's almost a requirement these days that you have a professional online presence, so this is a good way to start building that online portfolio. In Modules 2 and 3, you've been building on a Web page that displays personal information about you. </p>

          <p>Traditional printed resumes typically are required to fit on a single piece of paper (A4 or Letter sizes), which means they need to make very effective use of the space available. For this project, you are going to try to reproduce a typical resume layout but with HTML and CSS.Here is what my Web resume looks like. </p>

          <p>To more closely simulate a paper resume, your entire page's content must be centered in the middle 75% of the page. All your content should remain centered, and in the same position relative to the other elements on the page when you resize the
          browser window. </p>
